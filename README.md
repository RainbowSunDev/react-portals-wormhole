# 🕳 React Portals: Creating a wormhole

## Description

In this project I want to show you how we can use **React Portals** to create amazing features like a wormhole.

What we will do is set a draggable spaceship that we could move around the screen and place into a wormhole to go to another part of the screen. This feature is achieven using **React Portals** and the hook `useRef` to maintain a reference to the two wormholes.

## You will learn

Use **React Portals** to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

Use `useRef` hook to keep references to DOM elements. 

Use the library (**React Draggable**)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable] to move the spaceship around the screen.

## Run the project

Use `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
